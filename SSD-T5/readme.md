**Progress**

1. _ongoing_
    - cosine similarity using word embeddings
2. _brainstorm_
    - cross-entropy loss using moving window strategy
3. _done_
    - cosine similarity using utterance embeddings
        -  TLC factors: 
            -  disorganized speech is positively correlated with similarity [**clinical data**: Remora]
            -  null effects regarding impaired expressivity [**clinical data**: Remora]
        -  group difference:
    - cross-entropy loss using static strategy
        -  TLC factors: 
        -  group difference:
