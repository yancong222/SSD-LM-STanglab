**Progress**

1. _ongoing_
    - cosine: benchmarking with GloVe embeddings
    - perplexity: derive perplexity with stride > 3
2. _todo_
    - moving windows and embeddings
3. _done_
    - cosine similarity
        -  TLC factors: 
            -  disorganized speech is positively correlated with similarity [**clinical data**: Remora]
            -  weak effects regarding impaired expressivity [**clinical data**: Remora]
        -  group difference:
            - SD can better discern HV and SSD
            - Mean is not as good
    - derive perplexity with stride = 3
        - TLC factors: 
            - disorganized speech is positively correlated with perplexity [**clinical data**: YT passage]
            - impaired expressivity is weakly positively correlated with perplexity [**clinical data**: YT passage]
        - group difference:
            - todo
