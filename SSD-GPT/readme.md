**Progress**

1. _ongoing_
    - derive perplexity with stride > 3
2. _todo_
    - moving windows and embeddings
3. _done_
    - cosine similarity
        -  TLC factors: 
            -  disorganized speech is positively correlated with similarity (dataframe: Remora)
            -  null effects regarding impaired expressivity (dataframe: Remora)
        -  group difference:
    - derive perplexity with stride = 3
        - TLC factors: 
            - disorganized speech is positively correlated with perplexity (dataframe: YT passage)
            - impaired expressivity is negatively correlated with perplexity (dataframe: YT passage)
