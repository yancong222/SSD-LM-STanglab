**Progress**

1. _ongoing_
    - derive perplexity with stride > 3
2. _todo_
    - moving windows and embeddings
3. _done_
    - cosine similarity
        -  TLC factors: disorganized speech is positively correlated with similarity
        -  group difference:
    - derive perplexity with stride = 3
        - TLC factors: disorganized speech is positively correlated with perplexity, impaired expressivity is negatively correlated with perplexity
